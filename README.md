# Details! - Skin 'The War Within'

World of Warcraft Addon that adds the **'The War Within'** Skin (inspired by **/u/Sm0keO**) to **Details!**.

View on Curseforge: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/details-skin-the-war-within

## Features

## How to use

Open the _Details!_ options ('/details options'), and apply the Skin under **Options > Skins > Skin > 'The War Within'**.

If you have issues with Details overriding your settings, you can also use **'/tww import'** to import a default profile, which doesn't use the skin directly, but has the style/textures etc set manually.

## Support

If you want to support the development, like and share, but if you're feeling extra kind, you can [buy me a slice of pizza.](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/karlheinzschneider "https://www.buymeacoffee.com/karlheinzschneider") . Thanks!
